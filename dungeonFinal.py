#All in all, this was incredibly fun to write. I imagine from an experienced coder's point of view that this is incredibly messy on the backend. It's evident that I was working with what I am more familiar with. I've learned that I should be reaching out into fields where I am not as familiar. It's easy to get carried away with a fun idea. You want it to work so bad that you would only use what you know already, rather than risk it with something you are more likely to be frustrated with. I look forward to working with this script again and possibly refactoring this into something that uses classes, has sounds, and uses an actual GUI rather than just being text based. I've spent quite a few hours debugging this, but I am sure someone or myself will still end up finding ways to break this script. One other thing that I would change is the order of functions, or possibly storing them in their own module.
